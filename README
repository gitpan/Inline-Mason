DESCRIPTION
       This module enables you to embed mason scripts in your perl code. Using it
       is simple, much is shown in the above.

       'as_subs' is an option. Invoking Inline::Mason with it may let you treat
       virtual files as subroutines and call them directly.

       This module uses Text::MicroMason as its backend instead of HTML::Mason,
       because it is much lighter and more accessible for this purpose. Please go
       to Text::MicroMason for details and its limitations.
